## Rustbelt towns

After the election, the media pounced on towns and cities in the rustbelt as being the cause for Hillary Clinton's loss. Reporters travelled across the US and interviewed Trump voters who had a bunch of economic rationale behind their vote for Trump. It doesn't necessarily ring true. Fortunately the US government releases data that can give us a snapshot of the effect of Trump on the people who voted him in. The current working hypothesis is they are delusional and Trump is going to tank their economy. So let's put this fancy liberal elite education to the test and crunch some numbers.

% #summary(cars)
